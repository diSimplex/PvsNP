We explore the classical P vs NP problem in computation.

Naively, we might assume that any algorithm which solves any particular P =/= NP problem, is a "mathematical function". That is, any such algorithm, is a Turing Machine which does not have any "external" dependencies on the "non-mathematical" "world" "out there".

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from "the Truth".

Essentially, the "P =/= NP" problem is as difficult as Quantum Relativity.

Essentially we are, given a specific algorithm, conducting a "lion hunt" (using Konig's lemma). essentially we built the collection of occurrence nets associated with the specified coloured graph of the algorithm. We look at the tree of symbolic sequences (we may need Shield's parallel symbolic vectors).

We need to show that these trees are:

1. infinite (there are an infinite number of SAT exemplars with the same finite symbolic sequence).
2. the computational cost of resolving "most" of these exemplars grows exponentially (since "most" of SAT's exemplars are globally defined (small changes to the potential solution require large/global changes to the solution).
