We explore the classical P vs NP problem in computation.

Naively, we might assume that any algorithm which solves any particular P =/= NP problem, is a "mathematical function". That is, any such algorithm, is a Turing Machine which does not have any "external" dependencies on the "non-mathematical" "world" "out there".

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from "the Truth".

Essentially, the "P =/= NP" problem is as difficult as Quantum Relativity.
